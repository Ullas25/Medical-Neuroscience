# Medical-Neuroscience
Medical Neuroscience course is offered by the **Duke University** through [Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/) [ ---***In progess***---]

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience?)

The course instructor is Prof. [Leonard E. White](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~901314). The course covers Neuroanatomy, Neural Signalling, Sensory Systems, Movement and Motor Control, Brain Development, and Cognition. This is very intensive course. I literally have spent 100s of hours on this course (including recommended text book study). I have to say, this is my favourite and difficult course that I have taken so far.
