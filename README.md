# Medical-Neuroscience
This is my notes of Medical Neuroscience course offered by the Duke University through Coursera. [ ***IN PROGRESS*** ]

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience?)

The course instructor is Prof. [Leonard E. White](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~901314).The course covers Neuroanatomy, Neural Signalling, Sensory Systems, Movement and Motor Control, Brain Development, and CognitionThis is very intensive course. I literally have spent 100s of hours on this course (including recommended text book stuy). I have to say, this is my fauvorite and difficult course that I have taken so far. 

Usefull resources for the course:

File discription:
As GitHb only allows to upload <= 25mb/file , I had to upload my scanned notes in parts. My notes are names as ***Part_(part_number)_Medical_Neuroscience_Notes***.

*Note: My notes is not yet complete, I will be uploading the remaining in the days to come.*
